	If you want to remove public on your URL. then follow below process.
	
	By default Flarum's directory structure includes a public directory which contains only publicly-accessible files. This is a security best-practice, ensuring that all sensitive source code files are completely inaccessible from the web root.

	However, if you wish to host Flarum in a subdirectory (like yoursite.com/forum), or if your host doesn't give you control over your webroot (you're stuck with something like public_html or htdocs), you can set up Flarum without the public directory.

	Simply move all the files inside the public directory (including .htaccess) into the directory you want to serve Flarum from. Then edit ".htaccess" and uncomment lines 9-15 in order to protect sensitive resources. For Nginx, uncomment lines 8-11 of ".nginx.conf."

	You will also need to edit the "index.php" file and change the following line:
	
	$site = require './site.php';
	
	Edit the site.php and update the paths in the following lines to reflect your new directory structure:
	
	'base' => __DIR__,
	'public' => __DIR__,
	'storage' => __DIR__.'/storage',
	
	Finally, check config.php and make sure the url value is correct.
