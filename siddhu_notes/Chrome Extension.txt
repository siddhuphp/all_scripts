Chrome Extension

manifest.json	
	Firstly we need to talk about manifest.json file. This is the main fail to config the Chrome 
	Extension. All the config will happen this file only.

Content_script
	Content_script is something will work after webpage loaded. You can impilment this in particular
  website too. Simple it excute the code after webpage loaded.
	Ex:
		"content_scripts":[
        {
            "matches":["https://www.aliexpress.com/*"],
            "all_frames": true,
            "js":["jquery-3.4.1.min.js","scripts/content.js"]
        }
    ]

		Above content_scripts has array to load multiple things. 
		-matches: for set urls to work Chrome Extension. 
		-all_frames: this is work even website has iframes
		-js: this is for load js files and those files will run after webpage loaded.
				Note: you have to put jquery first. If you are using Jquery. It will load files in order way. 

background (background script)
	Background_script is something that will run in backgroun. for example if user clicks on new tab,
	user write something on browser urls. user close the current tab like that.

	Background scripts are registered in the manifest under the "background" field. They are listed in
	an array after the "scripts" key, and "persistent" should be specified as false.

	Ex:
		"background": {
			"scripts": ["background.js"],
			"persistent": false
  	},

	Multiple background scripts can be registered for modularized code.

	Ex:
		 "background": {
       "scripts": [
         "backgroundContextMenus.js",
         "backgroundOmniBox.js",
         "backgroundOauth.js"
       ],
       "persistent": false
     },

Chrome API
	If user clicked on default_icon and you want fire a function as background script
	ex:
		chrome.browserAction.onClicked.addListener(buttonClicked)
		function buttonClicked(){ // call back function
    	console.log("button Clicked");
		}
