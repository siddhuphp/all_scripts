The basic commands that learn must

ls		=>	The command line looks at the folder you are in, and then “lists” the files and folders inside it.
pwd		=>	It stands for ‘Print Working Directory’ and it tells you which directory currently you are in.
cd		=>	cd stands for 'change directory'. This command takes a directory name as an argument, and switches into that directory.
mkdir	=>	The command stands for 'make directory'.It takes in a directory name as an argument, and then creates a new directory in the current working directory.
touch	=>	The command creates a new file inside the working directory. It takes in a filename as an argument, and then creates an empty file in the current working directory.
cd ../.. => The command will send you back to main parent directory.


ls -a	=> The -a modifies the behavior of the ls command to also list the files and directories starting with a dot (.). Files started with a dot are hidden, and don’t appear when using ls alone.

	We can say this '-a' is option. the ls command has several more options. Here are three common options
	-a => lists all contents, including hidden files and directories
	-l => lists all contents of a directory in long format
	-t => order files and directories by the time they were last modified.
 
 example
 $ ls -l
drwxr-xr-x 5  cc  eng  4096 Jun 24 16:51  action
drwxr-xr-x 4  cc  eng  4096 Jun 24 16:51  comedy
drwxr-xr-x 6  cc  eng  4096 Jun 24 16:51  drama
-rw-r--r-- 1  cc  eng     0 Jun 24 16:51  genres.txt

1. Access rights. These are actions that are permitted on a file or directory.
2. Number of hard links. This number counts the number of child directories and files. This number includes the parent directory link (..) and current directory link (.).
3. The username of the file’s owner. Here the username is cc.
4. The name of the group that owns the file. Here the group name is eng.
5. The size of the file in bytes.
6. The date & time that the file was last modified.
7. The name of the file or directory.

ls -alt 	=> Here, ls -alt lists all contents, including hidden files and directories, in long format, ordered by the date and time they were last modified.
In addition to using each option separately, like ls -a or ls -l, multiple options can be used together, like ls -alt.

cp copy_file_namels paste_file_name	=> This command used for copy the file.
